"""In-memory `RoomManager` for the battle feature.

Notes for reviewers:
- This is intentionally process-local. With uvicorn `--reload`, room state
  resets on every code change, which is fine for the current dev scope.
- Concurrency is guarded by one `asyncio.Lock` per room. A separate
  manager-level lock guards `_rooms` itself during create/delete.
- Background tasks (countdown / recording timer) are tracked per room so
  abandonment can cancel them cleanly.
