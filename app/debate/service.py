"""Debate turn analysis service.

Inlines the same pipeline used by ``POST /analyze`` (``analyze_audio`` in
``app.api.analysis_routes``) but adapted for a debate turn:

- No ``expected_text`` is supplied — debate turns are free-form speech.
- The ``communication`` section is marked N/A for debate turns.
- The ``debug`` section is a stub (no transcript comparison).
- ``save_attempt`` failures are swallowed at WARNING so a persistence
  hiccup never blocks a turn from being recorded upstream.

Public callables:

- ``analyze_turn_audio(file, user)``: runs the full pipeline and returns
  ``(audio_asset, transcription, pronunciation, fluency, analysis_id)``
  for the room manager to combine with participant/turn metadata.
- ``compute_ai_score(pronunciation, fluency)``: pure function that folds
  the two per-turn signals into a single 0–100 score, returning also a
  boolean flag when neither signal was usable.
- ``compute_ai_score_with_content(...)``: enhanced scoring including LLM
  content analysis (relevance, arguments, structure, vocabulary).
